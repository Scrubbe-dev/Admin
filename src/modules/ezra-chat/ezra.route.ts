 *       This endpoint uses Ezra AI to interpret a natural language prompt, extract filters (priority and timeframe),
 *       fetch matching incidents assigned to the authenticated user, and stream back a **markdown-formatted summary**.
 *
 *       Ezra may also suggest next steps, such as raising an incident or creating an alert.
 *       If escalation or alerting is appropriate, Ezra will include a plain-text `ACTION:` indicator at the end
 *       (e.g., `ACTION: raise_incident` or `ACTION: alert`).
 *
 *       Ezra can also provide relevant URLs for user actions when requested or contextually appropriate.
 *
 *       Summaries may include **"raise as an incident" links** that, when clicked, pre-fill the incidentâ€™s ID, title,
 *       priority, and description into the frontend modal. For High or Critical priority incidents, Ezra may remind
 *       users that these links can be used to escalate directly.
 *
 *       No JSON metadata is returned; responses are strictly plain-text markdown with optional ACTION lines.
